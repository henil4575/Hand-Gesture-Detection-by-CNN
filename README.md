Excited to share my latest project: Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV!

🖐 Hand gesture recognition holds immense potential for applications in human-computer interaction, robotics, and accessibility. 
Leveraging the power of CNNs and OpenCV, I've developed a robust system capable of accurately detecting and classifying hand gestures in real-time.

🚀 Key Features:
CNN Architecture: Custom CNN architecture tailored for hand gesture recognition tasks, trained on a diverse dataset.
Real-time Processing with OpenCV: Integrated with OpenCV for live video stream processing, ensuring low-latency performance.
Gesture Classification: Trained the model to classify detected hand gestures into predefined classes, enabling seamless interaction with the system.
Easy Integration: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to integrate into various applications and environments.
🔑This project demonstrates the machine learning techniques to create an intuitive and interactive system capable of understanding and responding to human gestures in real-time.
